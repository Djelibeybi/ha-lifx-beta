# LIFX (Beta)

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This is a beta version of the built-in LIFX integration that includes
a new discovery method that should result in more consistent bulb detection as
well as the ability to configure certain discovery and retry settings to
optimize the integration for your network.

It is highly recommended that logging be configured to at least `INFO` level,
if not `DEBUG`.

See [the documentation](./info.md) for details of this and more.
